This is the solution to a design for a homepage about furniture. It has different hero images, which the user can click through and adjusts well to different screen sizes.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS grid 
- css background image

### What I learned

This challenge was very useful to get more acquainted with CSS grid. I had also never coded a carousel for the hero section before, which was easier than expected. I think the page adjusts very nicely to different viewports and I'm proud that I managed to do it in an easy way where all of the proportions stay intact. 

### Continued development

I think the design could use some more work in terms of contrast, maybe choosing a slightly different background color.
